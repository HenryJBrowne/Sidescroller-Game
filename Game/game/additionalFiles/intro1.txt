We Begin as Prince Reuben, son of Barnabus III and brother of the great warrior Eugene,
is about to get coronated. The city is cheering knowing the royal bloodline still
lives on and will continue to be prosperous during the reign of Reuben.

However, when there is happiness there is also rage and sadness and descending on the city
in secret is the wrath of Reginald the Demented, a dangerous and powerful enemy known 
for his pure evil and dark ways.

Suddenly in all the happiness the sky turns black with evil and darkness. This is no
coincidence as Reginald the Demented descends from the heavens pouring with dark energy
and pure evil. The guards charge at the dark lord, but his Knights are 
already prepared for this defensive attack. With the knights taking out the palace guards,
Reuben and Eugene draw their weapons ready for a fight. With a dark pulse shooting out
of Reginald's hands like the arrow Eugene was knocked unconscious and knocking out Reuben.
Reginald takes Reuben the future king to the cruel plains of Hells Point.

This is the day Reginald's vengeance began as he had possession of the king and left
Kratol without a ruler. With Reuben missing and palace guards knocked down. 
Eugene stands in a city of chaos and destruction it has been decimated by Reginald and his
three Knights Kraul,Igor and Jyrik leaving next to nothing standing.
Eugene must retrieve his brother. Eugene must save Kratol...
