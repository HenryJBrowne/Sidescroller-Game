Ozorath: Behold I am Ozorath the Great. I am the grand mage.
Eugene: I am Eugene of Kratol.
Ozorath: Your Prince Eugene? What brings you out this far?
Eugene: My brother and heir to the throne was taken by Reginald.
Ozorath: Oh, Dark Lord Reginald is very dangerous, here take this.
*Gives Eugene a book*
Eugene: What is this?
Ozorath: It's a book. You can find a ability called blink there.
Eugene: What is it doing?
Ozorath: It allows you to teleport a few paces in direction you are facing. Use it while jumping. 
Eugene: Thank you. That can be very useful. Well, I best be off.
Ozorath: Good Luck.
