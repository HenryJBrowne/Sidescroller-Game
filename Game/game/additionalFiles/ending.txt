Eugene has proved to be the hero of Kratol 
and saved his brother Reuben. He has proven 
himself against Reginald and his three knights 
which makes him the greatest warrior in all of Kratol. 
A true hero he has been and with a heart of steel and 
so much skill with a sword he is a force to be reckoned with.
